Please follow the steps below to run the [iteen] program. Make sure you have Node.js installed before proceeding.

Step 1: Install Node.js
If you haven't installed Node.js, please visit the official Node.js website at https://nodejs.org and download the appropriate version for your operating system. After successful installation, you can use Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) in the command line.

If you don't have Visual Studio Code, download and install the latest version from the official Visual Studio Code website at https://code.visualstudio.com/.

Step 3: Install Live Server Extension
Open Visual Studio Code after the installation is complete and access the Extensions Marketplace (Ctrl+Shift+X or View -> Extensions) to find and install the Live Server extension. The Live Server extension will help you easily run your web application and automatically refresh the page when you make changes in the source code.

Step 4: Prepare the [iteen] Source Code

Find the index.html file or the main page of the application.
Right-click on the index.html file and choose "Open with Live Server" from the displayed menu. (Alternatively, you can press Alt+L, Alt+O)
Your default browser will automatically open and run the [iteen] application. If you make any changes to the source code, the page will refresh automatically to display the latest changes.
Now you have successfully run the [iteen] program on your computer using VS Code and Live Server.
